# Dodecadone Steam Edition
### Hi, my name's chris pratt, and you are DO- DECA- DONE!

This is a silly game about silly shapes doing silly things. It has mod support, themes, and 28 default traits.

I've chosen for this project to be Open-Source, under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International.

This means you can
- Share the code
- Adapt the code
But, you must
- Attribute me (Lachlan Noble, or coding398)
- Not sell it in any way (Not commercial)
- Use the same license, Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International

I would also heavily enjoy if you were to support my work via donations. This can be done in-game, and will show for other players.

If you don't want to contribute financially, the best you can do is share the Steam version with others.

**Keep in mind this is all spaghetti code lmao. Any person looking to one-up me with Prettier and that shabang will be exhiled.**
